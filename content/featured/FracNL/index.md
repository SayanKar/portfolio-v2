FracNL is a DeFi platform enabling users to borrow by locking fractional NFTs as collateral, with lenders participating against listings.

Borrowers provide additional tokens as security. Even if a loan defaults, borrowers retain partial ownership of their collateral based on the principal repaid after full interest payment.
