FracNL is a DeFi platform where users can borrow by locking a fraction of their NFTs as collateral. Lenders participate against listings, backed by a credit score system.

Borrowers must provide additional tokens based on their credit score as security. If the loan defaults, these tokens compensate lenders; otherwise, they go to the platform as fees.

Borrowers retain partial ownership of their collateral if a loan defaults, receiving a portion back based on the principal amount returned after full interest payment within the loan period.
