Gencom offers a gamified platform for creating and owning NFTs through decentralized collaboration. Users bid on pixels, earning profits and fractional NFT ownership in our Play-to-Earn (P2E) model.

Our dynamic NFTs, built with ink!, polkadot.js, and React, maintain value beyond the game for a secondary market.
