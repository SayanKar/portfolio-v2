Gencom offers a gamified platform for creating and owning NFTs through decentralized collaboration.

Users bid on pixels to own and color them, earning profits from sales and fractional NFT ownership in our Play-to-Earn (P2E) model.

Our dynamic NFTs, developed using ink! smart contracts, polkadot.js, and React, sustain value beyond the game with a dynamic state for the secondary market.
